  <h2 align="center">Minesweeper</h2>

A rendition of the classic Minesweeper game. The aim of the game is to clear out the board and not hit any mines in the process.

The project uses a basic server built in express to access the webpage. A server was used as the project contains a JS module and access to it is blocked by the browsers CORS policy. This layout layout also makes sense if you wanted to serve this page on other servers.
